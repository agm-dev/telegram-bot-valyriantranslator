# telegram-bot-valyriantranslator
Telegram bot that translates texts to invented "Valyrian" language :D

You can find this code running on https://telegram.me/valyriantranslatorbot

If you want to test this code with your own bot, **you must create a key/telegram-key.js that 
exports a variable with the api key of your Telegram's bot.**

This bot can be used from inline querys: go to any chat on Telegram and start your message with 
@valyriantranslatorbot. Then write the text to traduce. The bot will offer you a translation.
Click on it and that's all!

You can open a chat with this bot; it will translate every message you send to it.
